	<h1>Racquetball: Failure to Move Penalty Hinders</h1>
	
	<p>The USAR rules state:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		When your opponent is in front of you, the player on offense should have the opportunity to hit the ball straight-in to the front wall and to the front wall at such an angle that causes the ball to rebound directly to the rear corners of the court. If the defensive player blocks any of these paths to the front wall, a penalty hinder (formerly "avoidable hinder") should be called when the offensive player either holds up or else hits the defensive player with the ball.
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>The following illustrations demonstrate these shots from different court positions.<p>
	
	<h2>Shots from the left (<a download="left-shots.svg" href="left-shots.svg" title="Download left shots illustration">Download</a>)</h2>
	<img src="left-shots.svg">
	<p>The down-the-line and left pass shots are basically indistinguishable. The right pass should target around the center of the front wall.</p>
	<p>The defensive player should not be anywhere along the left wall unless they are behind the offensive player. They may occupy a mid-court position as far forward as the short line.</p>
	
	<h2>Shots from left of center</h2>	
	<img src="left-center-shots.svg">
	<p>The pass shots for both sides should target the front wall no wider than half the distance between the player and the appropriate side walls. In this case, approximately 3 feet from the left wall and 7 feet from the right wall.</p>
	<p>The defensive player must evacuate a wider position in the middle of the court, but may be to either side of the offensive player. They may occupy a mid-court position as far forward as the short line as long as they are right of center.</p>
	
	<h2>Shots from the center</h2>
	<img src="center-shots.svg">
	<p>The pass shots for both sides should target the front wall no wider than half the distance between the player and the appropriate side walls. In this case, approximately 5 feet from each side wall.</p>
	<p>The defensive player must evacuate the entire center of the court unless they are behind the offensive player. They may stand anywhere to the sides of the offensive player as long as they are not blocking the cross-court shots.</p>
	
	<h2>Shots from right of center</h2>
	<img src="right-center-shots.svg">
	<p>The pass shots for both sides should target the front wall no wider than half the distance between the player and the appropriate side walls. In this case, approximately 7 feet from the left wall and 3 feet from the right wall.</p>
	<p>The defensive player must evacuate a wider position in the middle of the court, but may be to either side of the offensive player. They may occupy a mid-court position as far forward as the short line as long as they are left of center.</p>
	
	<h2>Shots from the right</h2>
	<img src="right-shots.svg">
	<p>The down-the-line and right pass shots are basically indistinguishable. The left pass should target around the center of the front wall.</p>
	<p>The defensive player should not be anywhere along the right wall unless they are behind the offensive player. They may occupy a mid-court position as far forward as the short line.</p>
	
	<h2>Observations</h2>
	<p>It can be observed that in all the above cases, there is approximately a 10 foot window on the front wall to which the offensive player is entitled. Drawing lines from the ends of this window to the offensive player forms a triangle. From this, we can see that the farther from the front wall a defensive player is, the more horizontal room they have to position themselves.</p>
	<p>In the illustrations above, it can be observed that the defensive player can occupy position in the center of the court as far forward as the encroachment line as long as the offensive player is not hitting from the center themselves. The closer the offensive player is to the center, the farther from the center the offensive player must move.</p>
	<p>From these observations, two fairly obvious "rules" can be made:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Don't stand farther forward in the court than necessary. (The receiving line is generally good.)</li>
		<li>Attempt to place the ball as close to the side walls as possible.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Other Notes</h2>
	<p><i>While the following statements are generally accepted, they are, as written, my own opinion. Rely upon the USAR for the exact rules and official interpretations, and then your tour, conference, and/or tournament directors for any clarifications or modifications that are applicable to you.</i></p>	
	<p>The shots which are not subject to failure to move penalty hinders are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Defensive shots (ceiling, back wall, around-the-world, etc.)</li>
		<li>Offensive shots that impact the side wall first (pinches, splats, etc.)</li>
		<li>Offensive shots that will not travel directly back to the hitter or either of the rear corners (wrap-around passes, z-shots, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If the offensive player holds up instead of taking the shot, they will receive a penalty hinder call if the defensive player is impeding any of the three essential shots, regardless of what their intent was. If they do not hold up, the shot they hit must be one of the three essential shots for a penalty hinder to be called.</p>
	<p>Jumping to evacuate the offensive lanes is not specifically addressed in the rules, and is only commonly seen in high levels of play. The <b>minimum</b> requirements for a jump to warrant a replay hinder instead of a penalty hinder are:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>The offensive player must hold their shot. If they shoot and strike the jumping defensive player with one of the three essential shots, the call shall be a penalty hinder.</li>
		<li>The jump must be sufficiently high so that the ball could travel to the front wall without a decrease in its height from where it was hit. If the offensive player would have to shoot the ball at a downward angle to not hit the jumping defensive player, the call shall be an avoidable hinder.</li>
		<li>The jump must be timed so that the offensive player can make their shot with confidence. If the jump is late (or early) and there is not reasonable confidence that the offensive player could have taken the shot without striking the defensive player, the call shall be a penalty hinder.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>A player's estimated skill ability to hit a shot has no bearing on the penalty hinder call. If they hold up and a defensive player is impeding any of the three essential shots, a penalty hinder shall be called. This is true regardless of the movement of the ball, how the offensive player is standing (unless they are obviously attempting a back-wall shot), or how the offensive player has failed to execute the same or similar shots before. If they do not hold up and the ball strikes the defensive player, then the direction of the shot shall be the only thing that is judged. The speed at which the ball is traveling and the height of the shot have no bearing on the call unless it is obvious that the ball would not make it to the front wall.</p>
	<p>The only time to not call penalty hinders based on skill is if an entire division is opted out of penalty hinders (for example, D/Novice). Additionally, all players in a match may agree to allow replay hinder calls only, but this is strongly discouraged, especially at high levels of play.</p>
	<p>Any player being awarded a point or hand/side-out against their opponent from a penalty hinder call may decide to replay the previous rally instead, if they so choose. This is obviously disadvantageous to that player, but they may feel that it is more fair in some cases. For example, they were holding up for a safety concern but believed that they had all of their essential shots, and the referee called a penalty hinder.</p>
	<p>If the offensive player takes a shot and does not strike the defensive player, play shall continue unless they indicated they were hindered prior to the ball leaving their racquet. Likewise, if they indicated that they were hindered before the ball left their racquet, play should stop immediately. Players may not win a rally if their shot is good after they indicated they were hindered, nor may they avoid a loss of a rally if their shot skipped but they did not indicate that they were hindered before the ball left their racquet. Players who are attempting to exploit penalty hinder calls should be warned and then disciplined if they continue with the behavior. Examples:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A player takes a full swing on a shot. The ball skips, and they then claim that they were hindered.</li>
		<li>A player indicates that they are hindered, inhibiting the referee and other players from effectively continuing the rally. However, they then decide to take the shot anyway, roll it out, and try to claim victory of the rally <b>because of their shot</b>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Both of these behaviors are cheating, and should not be tolerated. In the latter case, the offensive player may still win the rally due to the indicated hinder being a penalty hinder, but the former case may never result in a call other than loss of the rally for the offensive player. If the shot taken in the latter case is not one of the three essential shots, the referee may be inclined to call a replay hinder instead of a penalty hinder, even if a defensive player was impeding one of the essential shots. Therefore, if an offensive player is hindered due to a defensive player failing to move, it is best to hold up, or at least attempt one of the essential shots. Not holding up for a failure to move hinder and attempting a non-essential shot is a sure way to substantially lower your chance to win a rally.</p>
